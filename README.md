A simple CRUD API with OAuth using FastAPI

This project served as a simple multi platform Information system used personally by me. 

A mongodb is required and a user database with user_collections is manually created. Following informations are required:

  "email": "your preferences",
  "password": "your pass"

To use: 

pip install requirements.txt

Create a .env file and add 3 parameters below:

MONGO_URI
JWT_SECRET
JWT_ALGO

or you can change directly from the file itself.
